What to do

[x] 1. Add your group members' names to README.md. 
[x] 2.  Implement your algorithm in C/C++/Java. 
[x] 3. Compile and execute the program using the examples provided.
[x] 4. Write a clear pseudocode for each algorithm, describe what parameters are needed to execute each program, include snapshots from each execution using the test data, and submit it as a PDF report. Submit your PDF by committing it to your GitHub repository along with your code. 
[x] Your report should include the following: Your names, CSUF-supplied email address(es), and an indication that the submission is for project 1.
[x] A full-screen screenshot with your group member names shown clearly. One way to make your names appear in Atom is to simply open your README.md.
[x] The pseudocode of each algorithm.
[x] A brief description on how to run the code.
[x] Snapshots of code executed using the test data provided in the description of each algorithm. 

Grading rubric
The total grade is 40 points. Your grade will be comprised of three parts, Form, Function, and Report:
Function refers to whether your code works properly (30 points), 10 points for Calculate and 20 points for Verify.
Form refers to the design, organization, and presentation of your code. The instructor will read your code and evaluate these aspects of your submission (3 points):
README.md completed clearly (1 points)
Style (whitespace, variable names, comments, helper functions, etc.) (2 points)
Report (7 points) divided as follows:
Summary of report document (2 points)
Pseudocode of the chosen algorithm (2 points)
Three screenshots: one for the group members and two snapshots of code executing for some two distinct values of N (1 point each, total 3 points)
